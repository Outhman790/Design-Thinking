# 🏟️ Local Sports Field Management – Design Thinking Project

This project was carried out as part of a group assignment focused on **Design Thinking methodology**. It addresses real-world problems related to the mismanagement of local sports fields created under the **INDH (Initiative Nationale pour le Développement Humain)**.

---

## 📌 Project Context

Local sports fields were developed to:

* Bring **sports and educational activities** closer to neighborhoods
* Fight against **youth delinquency**
* Promote **citizenship values** and support youth development
* Encourage **community sports engagement**

However, poor management due to third-party associations has created several challenges:

* ❌ Inaccessible or unavailable reservation staff
* ❌ Double bookings and lack of transparency in scheduling
* ❌ No centralized platform to check field availability or hours

---

## 🎯 Goal

To **analyze** the current situation using **Design Thinking** and **propose a relevant, innovative solution** that improves the reservation and management process of local sports fields.

---

## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

The solution was developed by going through the 5 key phases of Design Thinking:

1. **Empathize** – Interviews and surveys with local youth and field managers
2. **Define** – Identify the core issues causing friction in the current system
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorm ideas to solve the problem (digital and non-digital)
4. **Prototype** – Create mockups and flowcharts for the selected idea
5. **Test** – Validate solution through feedback loops and iterations

---

## 📂 Deliverables

* 🎤 **Google Slides Presentation** illustrating all 5 Design Thinking stages
* 🧪 **Figma Prototype** *(if solution is digital)*
* ✅ **Task Breakdown** using **Trello**
* 💾 **GitHub Repository** for documentation and collaborative work

---

## 👥 Team Collaboration

* Team of 4 members
* Tasks divided clearly using Trello
* Group presentation to explain process and solution

---

## 🧩 Key Learning Outcomes

* ✅ Master the **Design Thinking framework**
* ✅ Develop user-centered problem-solving skills
* ✅ Collaborate effectively in teams
* ✅ Use tools like **Figma**, **Trello**, and **Google Slides**
* ✅ Document and present a structured solution on **GitHub**
